# 🚀 Sequence Detector FSM - Hackathon Submission (Mavenite Silicon)

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my submission for the **Level 2 Hackathon Challenge by Mavenite Silicon**.  
This project involves designing a **Sequence Detector for the pattern `10101`** using a **Moore FSM** with overlapping sequence detection.

---

## 📜 Problem Statement  

**Design a sequence detector that detects the sequence `10101` from an input data stream (MSB first).**  
- Implement the **Moore Finite State Machine (FSM)** for overlapping sequence detection.  
- Simulate, synthesize, and verify the design.
